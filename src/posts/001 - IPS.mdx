Dear readers, to start the “Finance” section of this blog I want to inspire and encourage open discussions about investing and personal finance, so I'll share with you my [IPS](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ips.asp).

What’s an IPS? An IPS is a document describing your investing goals and strategies, incorporating your risk tolerance, desired asset allocation, and specific plans to achieve them. The level of details that you can put in this, vastly depends on your situation. In fact, assuming that the strategy needs to be revised periodically, a too detailed IPS may end up in editing it too frequently, while a too generic IPS is mostly worthless.

Do you need an IPS? Need is a rather forceful word, but as many personal finance investors suggest, everyone that is going to invest money should have one. Basically you’re forcing yourself to think about your values, your long term strategy and if you really understand what and why you’re investing in. If you are currently investing I suggest you to write your own following [this](https://www.physicianonfire.com/you-need-an-investor-policy-statement/) post from [physicianonfire](https://www.physicianonfire.com/).

As my life continues to unfold, I’ll be making updates and changes, according to the progress of my journey. To keep some sort of “versioning control”, at the end I’ll write some notes for those modifications that needs an explanation or are backed by an analysis.

Enjoy!

## Objectives

- Long-term growth: My primary objective is to achieve steady long-term (more than 10 years) capital appreciation.
- Wealth preservation: I aim to preserve my wealth, considering inflation and the future financial needs of myself.

## Investment philosophy

- I will handle my investments myself: no active investing, no financial advisors (only for one-off), no robo-advisors.
- Invest mainly in low cost ETFs.
- Invest in single bonds if I need to allocate money for an expected future expense.
- No sector/themes ETFs.
- Buy and hold stocks strategy: stay invested (and extra invest if possible) if the market crashes.
- Review and rebalance the strategy every 2 years.

## Asset class ranking

Defining asset classes to invest:

1. Stocks (ETF): good
2. Bonds (individual): good
3. Bonds (ETF): good but only in the long term
4. Commodities and precious metals: no plans for now, not a huge fan
5. Private equities / Angel investing: no plans for now, but maybe in the future
6. Real Estates: not in the short/mid term (need to go into detail)
7. Stocks (individual): no. (only as “fun money”)
8. Cryptos: really?
9. Art pieces: not considered as an investment
10. Collectibles: not considered as an investment

## Asset allocation

This asset allocation is referred only to the investible share of my total asset. This is probably the section I will update most frequently.

- Stocks' ETFs (relative values)
    - 50% World Developed [LCWD]
    - 25% Emerging Markets [EIMI]
    - 10% Europe developed [IMAE]
    - 15% World Small Cap [WSML]

## World coverage

The following graphs give me a general overview of how I'm investing in countries and regions stocks.

## Cash

- Keep 10 - 12 months of living expenses in cash in my bank account while working.
- If liquidity has a high amount, invest some of it in a deposit account or single bonds.
- In case of urgent need of cash in a bear market, sell bonds first (that I don’t have for now since I don’t need cash in this period of my life).

## Open considerations and problems

- TODO: study and evaluate Value factor.
- What if I move to Switzerland to work there? Understand tax implications in the Toblerone's country.
- Buy a house? While I currently have a home in Italy, I probably won’t buy another one for me.
- Kids? Too early to know, but one day I’ll have to consider this scenario.
