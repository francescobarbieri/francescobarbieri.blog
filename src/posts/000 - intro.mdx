Let's take a brief moment to answer these questions in order.

## 1. What is this blog about?

This blog is mostly about finance and personal finance. As the word itself says, personal finance is different for everyone, so I thought it might be interesting and fun to put my own perspective out there. Some characteristics of this blog:

1. In general, posts must relate to finance or personal finance
2. At the same time, I don't want my entire identity to be about finance, so in the "thoughts" category there will be also off-topic posts that can be interesting or complementary to finance's ones. In the future I may add more categories to better split the content if this will grow significantly.
3. Itâ€™s never been a goal of mine to turn this into a side hustle. There will never be invasive ads or promotions.
4. Even if personal finance is, indeed, personal, I think that there are some common sense pillars that everyone should "build". So even thought I'm still learning, I'll write also about basic concepts that will apply for most of us, grouping them in a series of posts. I've seen a lot of disinformation about personal finance, especially in Italy and I wanto to make these pillars accessible to everyone, regardless of their levelof finance expertise.

## 2. Who the hell am I?

Hi! I'm Francesco. At the time of writing I'm a Freelance Developer and Computer Science student. Over the past year I've read loads of books (and blogs) about saving, investing and personal finance.
