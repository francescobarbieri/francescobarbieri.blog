                At that time I couldn't know it was the start of a career. Over the course of personal and university projects, as well as through my professional experiences, I have acquired valuable expertise in Java, JavaScript and web technologies. Currently, I am learning Machine Learning in my spare time.

            <TypographyP>
                Over the past decade, I've written content on my blog and newsletter. I try to keep things simple. You'll find writing about technologies I'm interested in at the time, or how I'm learning and growing in my career, sharing knowledge along the way.
