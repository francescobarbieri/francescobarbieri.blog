                    I write about events and topics that strike me. In my essays, you'll find reflections on the subjects that make me reflect the most. These often include technologies I'm currently interested in or insights into how I'm learning and growing in my career.

                    Over the past decade, I've written content on my blog and newsletter. I try to keep things simple. You'll find writing about technologies I'm interested in at the time, or how I'm learning and growing in my career, sharing knowledge along the way.
